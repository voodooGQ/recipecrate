# Shrimp Scampi

## Ingredients

- 1 lb raw shell-on shrimp
- 4 tbsp salted butter
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 lemon
- 1/2 cup of semi-dry white wine
- 1/2 cup shrimp stock (recipe below)
- 1 tsp Italian seasoning
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- Fresh cracked black pepper
- 4 servings (225g) pasta

## Instructions

1. De-shell and de-vein the shrimp. Place the shells in a medium sauce pan with 1 1/2 cup water and set on medium. Allow to cook for at least 15 minutes at a rolling boil before straining and setting aside.
1. Put a pot of water onto boil for your pasta with 1/4 cup kosher salt. You're looking for a "rod" style pasta such as spaghetti, fettucini, linguini, ect. This recipe is optimized for linguini, so when dropping the pasta in the subsequent steps ensure that your time is calibrated based on the cook time of linguini (about 8 to 10 minutes)
1. Wash the shrimp and place them on a plate lined with paper towels. You want one layer of shrimp. Place another paper towel on top and press down gently. You're looking to clean up any excess water on the shrimp. After dry sprinkle with the 1/2 tsp kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper.
1. Drop your pasta.
1. In a medium skillet heat 2 tbsp each of the butter and olive oil on medium. You are looking for the butter to finish foaming.
1. Take the plate of shrimp, remove the top layer of paper towel, and carefully invert into the pan. You're trying to get the whole layer out in one go without burning yourself.
1. Cook until you start to see browning. Once browning has started pull the shrimp. They will be undercooked but will be finished with the sauce.
1. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper flakes to the pan, just cooking until fragrant before moving to the next step.
1. Carefully throw the white wine into the pan and deglaze. Allow to cook for 30 seconds.
1. Juice half the lemon into the pan, catching any seeds with your hands.
1. Add the 1/2 cup of shrimp stock and allow to come back to a boil.
1. Turn the heat down to medium low and add your remaining 2 tbsp of olive oil and butter, whisk vigorously to emulsify the sauce. Allow to cook for 1 minute before adding the Italian seasoning.
1. Add your shrimp back to the pan and allow to cook for 1 minute.
1. By this time your pasta should just about be done, so drain and save 1 cup of the left over salted water.
1. Add the pasta to the sauce and coat. Add splashes of the saved water to loosen the sauce. Keep in mind it will thicken as it cools, so you want it more loose to start with.
1. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and parmesan cheese. Serve with the wine used for the sauce.
