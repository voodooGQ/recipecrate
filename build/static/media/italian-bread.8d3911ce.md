# Italian Bread

## Ingredients

### For the dough

- 200 grams sourdough starter
- 326 grams all purpose flour
- 170 grams lukewarm water
- 2 tsp instant yeast
- 1 3/4 tsp kosher salt

### For the wash

- 1 egg yolk beaten with 1 tablespoon water

## Instructions

1. Combine all ingredients into a large bowl, mix with your hands to combine.
2. In the stand mixer knead on speed 2 for 7 minutes. You’re looking for a smooth, slightly sticky dough.
3. Place in a lightly greased bowl, cover with greased cling wrap, and allow to rise in an unheated oven with a pan of boiled water for 45 minutes. Uncover and gently deflate the dough, flip over, and allow to rise for another 45 minutes.
4. Remove the dough from the oven. Place parchment paper on a sheet pan. Turn the dough out onto the sheet pan and form into a loaf shape.
5. Grease a sheet of cling wrap and place gently over the dough, you want it to be able to rise without being encumbered. Place back in the oven and allow to rise for another 60 to 90 minutes or until very puffy.
6. Remove the pan from the oven and preheat it to 425 degrees.
7. Remove the cling wrap from the bread and create three diagonal slices across the top about 1/2 inch deep.
8. Beat together the egg yolk and the water for the wash. Brush onto the loaf gently.
9. Place the bread in the oven and spray the bottom of the oven with water. Close the over door and allow to cook for 3 minutes. Open the oven and spray the bottom again.
10. Cook for 22 to 32 more minutes. The longer you cook it the crunchier it’ll be.
