## Ingredients

### For the chili

- 1 lb. 80/20 Ground Beef
- 10 oz. Pork Chorizo
- 1 Large Yellow Onion
- 3 Cloves Garlic
- 8 Snacking Sweet Peppers
- 1 Large Jalapeño
- 3 Roma Tomatoes
- 28 oz. Can Stewed Tomatoes
- 15 oz. Can Dark Red Kidney Beans
- 15 oz. Can Light Red Kidney Beans
- 15 oz. Can Pinto Beans
- 3 tbl. Tomato Paste
- 2 tsp. Salt
- 2 tsp. Brown Sugar
- 0.75 Bottle Lager

### For the spice blend

- 2 tbsp Cumin
- 3 tbsp Chili Powder
- 2 tsp Garlic Powder
- 2 tsp Onion Powder
- 1 tsp Oregeno
- 1/4 tsp Cayenne Pepper
- 1 tsp Sweet Paprika
- 1/2 tsp Hot Smoked Paprika
- 1 tsp Freshly Ground Black Pepper
- 2 tsp Ground Coffee
- 2 Whole Bay Leaves

## Instructions

This can be cooked in either a Dutch Oven or a Crock Pot. If you go the Dutch oven route just cook everything directly in there, otherwise use a pan for the pre-work.

1. Preheat the pan until medium-high.
2. Brown the chorizo for awhile until it starts to get some color to it. We don’t want it crispy at this point.
3. Throw in the ground beef and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Make sure to drain half way through so it can continue to crisp the chorizo.
4. While that’s browning roughly chop the onion. Slice the peppers down the middle and scoop out all the seeds with a spoon (wear gloves for the jalapeno). Then slice into 1/16th each pieces. Also crush and mince the garlic.
5. Once meat is browned remove from the pan and set aside.
6. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the fat in the pan and then add the onions, peppers, garlic, and the remaining teaspoon of salt. Turn down the heat to medium and allow the vegetables to sweat for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
7. Once the vegetables have had time to sweat throw in all the spices for the blend and cook for another 2 minutes stirring frequently.
8. While those are sweating drain and wash the beans in a colander. Drain the can of stewed tomatoes.
9. Add back the meat and the rest of the chili ingredients to the pan. Only add about 3/4 of the beer (and finish off the bottle yourself)
10. Cook on medium high heat until simmering (about 10 minutes)
11. At this point, if you’re using the dutch oven throw the cover on and put it in a preheated 300 degree oven. If you’re using a crock pot put it in there instead.
12. Cook in the oven for about 3 hours at 300. If using the crock pot cook on low for 8 hours or high for 4.

Remove the bay leaves before serving. I typically serve it over elbow macaroni. I add cheddar cheese, chopped scallions, sour cream, and some sort of small cheese cracker to the top (Cheez-its, Goldfish crackers, ect).

If you like things spicy feel free to add a chopped habanero in with the pepper blend and a tablespoon of mexican hot sauce (you can use sriracha too if you’d prefer).
