# Cinnamon Raisin Swirl Bread

## Ingredients

### For the dough

- 113 grams sourdough starter, fed
- 391 grams all purpose flour
- 3 1/2 tsp yeast
- 145 grams lukewarm water
- 71 grams soft butter
- 80 grams granulated sugar
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 2 tsp salt

### For the filling

- 100 grams granulated sugar
- 3 tsp cinnamon
- 4 tsp all purpose flour
- 100 grams raisins
- 0.5 egg beaten

### For the finished loaf

- 1 tsp melted butter

## Instructions

1. To make the dough: Combine all of the dough ingredients, and mix until you have a smooth dough, no need to knead after this point.
2. Place the dough in a lightly greased container, and allow it to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until it’s just about doubled in bulk. I typically throw this in an unheated oven with a pan of boiled water in the bottom to create humidity and an ideal bulking temp.
3. While the dough is rising, make the filling by stirring together the sugar, cinnamon, flour, and egg.
4. Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface.
5. Roll and pat the dough into a rough rectangle approximately 6′′ x 20′′.
6. Spread the filling evenly over the dough, making sure to leave an inch gap at the END of the rectangle (where you will finish when rolling) and 1/2 inch every where else.
7. Starting with a short end, roll the dough into a log. Pinch the ends to seal, and pinch the long seam closed.
8. Transfer the log, seam-side down, to a lightly greased 9′′ x 5′′ loaf pan. Cover and allow the bread to rise until it’s crested about 1′′ over the rim of the pan, about 1 hour.
9. While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 350°F.
10. Bake the bread for 55 minutes to an hour. The bread’s crust will be golden brown.
11. Remove the bread from the oven, and gently loosen the edges. Turn it out of the pan, and brush the top surface with butter, this will give it a soft, satiny crust. Allow the bread to cool completely before slicing.
