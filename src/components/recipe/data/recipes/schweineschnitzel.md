# Schweineschnitzel

## Ingredients

- 6 1/2 lb Pork Loin (Cut 1/2 inch and tenderized)
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 5 cups breadcrumbs (Vienna or Italian loaf preferred)
- 6 eggs
- 4 cups Vegetable Shortening (Crisco)

## Instructions

The pork loin should be cut to 1/2 inch thick slices with as much fat as possible trimmed from the outside. In my experience it’s easy to get a butcher to cut the slices for you, but you’ll be really lucky if they have a tenderizer they’re willing to run the meat through (they have one, they’ll just tell you they don’t because they don’t want to clean the thing after). If you can manage to get them to do both ask it to only be ran through the tenderizer once. If you can’t get the meat tenderized at the butcher you can tenderize it yourself at home with a crank style or mallet tenderizer.

### Dredge

In three separate containers place the flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs. Beat the eggs with 1
tablespoon of water. Season the breadcrumbs and flour with salt and pepper. Using alternating hands for the dry/wet ingredients.

1. Coat the cutlet completely with flour
1. Shake off any excess flour
1. Dip the cutlet in the egg wash
1. Pick up the cutlet with your OTHER hand
1. Hold up above the bowl for a few seconds to let the majority of the egg mixture drip off
1. Drop the cutlet into the breadcrumbs
1. With your ORIGINAL hand, grab a hand full of the bread crumbs and throw it on top of the
cutlet.
1. Press down firmly with your hand.
1. Flip the cutlet and repeat step 7, you’re looking for full coverage and to really stick it on there.

### Fry

About half way through your batch throw away the vegetable shortening, clean out the pan with a paper towel, and then start the process over again with the remainder of the shortening. This will help alleviate burnt bits and mucky flavors.

A loin makes a LOT of schnitzel, this is a process, to do everything this recipe entails you will probably be at this for a few hours. Luckily schnitzel freezes really well (precooked).

You can serve with just a squeeze of lemon, with some wonderfully flavorful Jager Gravy, or
ketchup. These are great left-over straight out of the fridge!
