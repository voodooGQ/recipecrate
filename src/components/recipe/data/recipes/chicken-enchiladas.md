# Chicken Enchiladas

## For the sauce

- 2 tbsp grape seed or vegetable
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 4 tbsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp dried oregano
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 1 tsp kosher salt

## For the enchiladas

- 4 tbsp grape seed or vegetable oil
- 1 small white onion, peeled and diced
- 1.5 pounds chicken diced
- 1 can (4 oz) diced green chiles, drained
- 1 can (15 oz) black beans, rinsed and drained
- 8 large flour tortillas
- 3 cups Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro chopped
- 1/2 cup Cotija cheese
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

## Instructions for the sauce

1. Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
2. Add flour and seasonings, cook for 1 minute to release the spice compounds and cook out the flour flavor.
3. Gradually stir in stock, whisking constantly. Ensure stock is incorporated before adding additional stock.
4. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes until thickened.

## Instructions for the enchiladas

1. Preheat your oven to 350F
2. In a large pan heat 2 tbsp of oil on medium-high until shimmering.
3. Add the onions and chiles to the pan and cook until the onions are translucent and tender.
4. Remove onion mixture from pan and add 2 more tbsp of oil. Cook your chicken until just done. Be careful not to overcook! If you'd prefer you can also shred rotisserie style chicken for this step.
5. Combine the chicken mixture with the onion mixture as well as the black beans.
6. Divide 1/8 of the mixture into each of the 8 tortillas, sprinkling with the Monterey jack cheese and a spoon full of the sauce before rolling and placing in a 9x13 baking dish.
7. Pour any remaining sauce and sprinkle remaining cheese cheese evenly over the top of the enchiladas.
8. Cook uncovered for 20 minutes.
9. Sprinkle with Cotija cheese and cilantro before serving.
