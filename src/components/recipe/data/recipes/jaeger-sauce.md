# Jaeger Sauce

## Ingredients

- 1/2 lb white button mushrooms
- 1 medium onion
- 5 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 3 tbsp flour
- 2 1/2 cups beef stock
- 1/2 tsp fresh or dried thyme
- 2 tsp. Maggi würze
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/4 tsp. black pepper
- 1 tbl. fresh squeezed lemon juice

## Instructions

Slice the onions thin and quarter the 1/2 pound of mushrooms. Cook the 3 tablespoons of the butter and the 1 tablespoon of oil on medium. Add the onions and mushrooms to the pan along with the salt and sauté until all the liquid has evaporated and the onions and mushrooms are golden brown (about
12 minutes).

Add the remaining butter to the plan as well as the flour and continue cooking for around 2 minutes, this step cooks the “flour taste” out of the flour. Once the flour is a nice golden brown add the white wine to the pan and whisk vigorously to combine into a rue, slowly add in the beef broth about 1/4 cup at a time whisking continuously.

Once all the beef broth has been incorporated add in the thyme, Maggi, pepper, and lemon. Reduce heat to medium-low and allow gravy to simmer for 5 to 7 minutes until thickened. You’re just looking for it to coat the back of a spoon.

Great on beef, pork, and knödel.
