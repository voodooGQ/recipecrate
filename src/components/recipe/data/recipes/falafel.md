# Falafel

**Note: This recipe is mostly in grams as that's how I experiment with exact ratios. When I make it again I'll take note of the imperial measurements and update**

## Ingredients

- 430g re-hydrated Garbanzo beans (not canned)
- 160g yellow onion chopped
- 11g garlic clove
- 35g parsley
- 35g cilantro
- 2 tsp unground cumin
- 2 tsp unground coriander
- 1/8 tsp Berbere or cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 5 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp whole-wheat flour
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. The night before you're going to make this put the Garbanzo beans in a bowl 6 times their size and fill half way with water. You need to use dried beans to get the right texture, canned will not do in this case.
1. The next day take all your ingredients and put them in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse 15 to 20 times or until you have the consistency of fine pebbles.
1. Roll into balls or discs and fry for about 4 minutes per side (or until golden brown if making balls).
1. Serve with vegetables, pita, sauces... like pretty much anything honestly.
