# Fried Rice

## Ingredients

### For the dish

- 2 cups day old long grain rice (Chinese take-out leftovers works great here)
- 1 cup protein (Shrimp, pork, chicken all work well)
- 4 eggs beaten
- 1 cup Ham
- 1 cup shoestring or sliced carrots
- 1/2 cup peas
- 1/2 a yellow onion chopped
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1/4 tsp crushed red peppers
- 1/3 to 1/2 cup neutral oil

### For the sauce

- 1/3 cup oyster sauce
- 1/3 cup soy sauce
- 1 tsp toasted sesame oil

## Instructions

1. In a cast iron pan or non-stick skillet add 3 tbls of the oil and fry your protein until golden brown. Remove from pan.
2. Add 2 tbsp more to your pan and let it get ripping hot, then throw in your eggs and stir vigorously. You should get nice big curds. Remove from pan.
3. 2 tbsp more oil, add the chopped onion, let cook until translucent. Add garlic and crushed red pepper. Let cook until just fragrant and then add your carrots, peas, and ham. Stir and allow to cook until the carrots are just barely tender. Remove from pan.
4. Add the rest of the oil and your rice. You want some nice color on the rice and for there to be crispy pieces throughout.
5. Once the rice has thoroughly browned add the sauce ingredients to the pan and stir.
6. Add back all the previously removed ingredients. Stir
7. Heat all together for about 2 minutes or until warm
