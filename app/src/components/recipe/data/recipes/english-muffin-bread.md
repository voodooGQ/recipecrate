# English Muffin Bread

## Ingredients

## For the Dough

- 550 grams all purpose flour
- 540 grams sourdough starter
- 32 grams sugar
- 23 grams salt
- 390 grams dry milk powder
- 2 tsp. instant yeast

## For the Second Phase

## Instructions

1. Combine all yeast, water, and sugar in a bowl. Allow to sit for about 10 minutes to activate.
2. Combine all the dry ingredients, followed by the starter and yeast mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer.
3. Mix on level 1 until combined, then on level 3 for about 3 minutes. You're looking for strands of dough to pull away from the bowl.
4. Cover the bowl with cling wrap and place in an unheated oven. In the bottom of the oven add a pan of boiled water. Allow to rise for about an hour or until doubled in size.
5. Pull the dough from the oven. Combine the water and baking soda from the "second phase step" and add to the dough.
6. Mix again on 1 until combine and then again on 3 for about 2 minutes, once again looking for the strands of dough.
7. Dump the mixture evenly into two lightly greased 9x5 loaf pans. Take a piece of cling wrap and spray some Pam on one side to stretch over the top of the loaf pans tightly.
8. Place back in the unheated oven and allow to rise for another hour or until the loaf is just below the cling wrap you put on earlier.
9. Remove the pans from the oven and turn it up to 375F. While the oven is heating up the bread should continue to rise and be flush with the top of the pan.
10. Put in the oven and cook for about 30 minutes. You're looking for it to be a nice golden brown mostly on top, though you may see some white spots from the baking soda reaction and this is fine.
11. Pull from the oven, remove from the pan, and place on a cooling rack for at least an hour before toasting.
