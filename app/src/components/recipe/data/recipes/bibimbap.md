1. Add the bok-choy with 1/3 of the saute suace. Cook until tender, remove from the pan and set aside.
1. Add the spinach with 1/3 of the saute sauce. Cook until tender, remove from teh pan and set aside.
1. Add the corn with 1/3 of the saute sauce. Cook until tender, remove from teh pan and set aside.
1. Mix together all the sauce drizzle ingredients.
1. Once the rice is done browning add it to a bowl with some of the chicken, and vegetables. Drizzle with sauce. Serve
