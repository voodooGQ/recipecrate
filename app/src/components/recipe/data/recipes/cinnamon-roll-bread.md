# Cinnamon Roll Bread

## Ingredients

### For the dough

- 388 grams all purpose flour
- 225 grams sourdough starter
- 55 grams lukewarm water
- 5 grams instant yeast
- 80 grams sugar
- 30 grams dry milk powder
- 70 grams unsalted butter
- 4 grams salt
- 2 grams vital wheat gluten
- 2 eggs

### For the filling

- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 tbsp cinnamon
- 1 egg beaten
- 2 tbsp flour

### For the frosting

- 4 tbsp unsalted butter softened
- 4 tbsp cream cheese
- 2 cups powdered sugar
- 1 tsp salt

## Instructions

1. In a bowl combine the yeast, 1 tablespoon of the sugar, and the water. Allow to sit for 10 minutes to “activate”. This step can be skipped if using instant yeast, but I still do it anyway.
2. Mix all ingredients with the exception of the flour and vital wheat gluten in the bowl of a stand mixer. Sift the flour and gluten together in a separate bowl. Slowly incorporate the flour mixture into the bowl about 1/4 cup at a time until all combined. Dough should be soft and just slightly sticky.
3. Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead by hand for 6 minutes. The dough should be soft and elastic. Place in lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover the bowl with lightly greased cling wrap.
4. Place in an unheated oven with a pan of boiled water. Allow to rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1 and 1/2 hours.
5. Gently deflate the dough and turn out onto lightly floured surface. roll out into approximately 6′′ to 20′′ rectangle.
6. Combine all the ingredients for the filling. With a spatula spread the mixture out over the dough leaving approximately 1/2 inch on 3 sides and 1 1/2 inch on the “end of the roll”
7. From the short end of the loaf roll up the dough, making sure to “bring in the sides” every few rolls to keep the roll compact.
8. Pinch the end of dough to seal. Flip down the sides in on themselves and pinch them too. You want the whole thing sealed. Place in a greased loaf pan seam side down.
9. Allow to rise for another hour or until it has risen 1 inch over the rim of the pan.
10. Heat the oven to 350 F and bake for 55 mins. About 25 minutes into cooking check to make sure it’s not getting too brown, if it is tent it with aluminum foil.
11. For the frosting whip all the ingredients together in a stand mixture with the exception of the milk. Slowly add in the milk until it has reached a spreading consistency.
12. Do not frost the bread until it has cooled for at least two hours. Reserve some of frosting to spread on the slices.

This can obviously easily be edited to make standard cinnamon rolls. Changes below:

1. Roll the dough into 18′′ x 20′′ rectangle.
1. Roll the log but don’t bother sealing off the dough.
1. Slice with unflavored dental floss into 12 individual pieces.
1. Cook at 400 F for 15 minutes
1. You can put the frosting on right away if you want it to be all melty
