# RecipeCrate.com

A personal recipe cache site for myself, friends, and loved ones.

Site is written in React and is deployed via CodePipeline in AWS. A small serverless application is used to easily sync the data to S3. This bucket is placed in front of CloudFront for efficient caching of resources.
